# Haskell Learning Journey

Welcome to my Haskell learning repository! This project serves as a personal record of my exploration and practice with the Haskell programming language. The code here includes a range of exercises, implementations, and notes that reflect my ongoing efforts to understand functional programming and improve my skills in Haskell.

## Objective

This repository aims to:

- Track my progress as I learn Haskell.
- Showcase examples of various concepts, patterns, and techniques as I gain experience with the language.
- Act as a personal reference and a potential resource for others learning Haskell.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains:

- **Code samples**: A collection of Haskell scripts demonstrating different concepts and techniques, from beginner to intermediate.
- **Exercise solutions**: Answers to problems and challenges encountered during my learning.
- **Documentation**: Notes and reflections throughout my learning process.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this repository is a work in progress and is intended solely for educational purposes. It is not meant for production use but rather to document my learning journey with Haskell.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or share suggestions!
